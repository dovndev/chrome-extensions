# Icon Files

The icons directory should contain the following PNG files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels)  
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These should be PNG format icons representing your extension.

For testing purposes, you can:
1. Create simple colored squares as placeholders
2. Use any image editor to create proper icons
3. Download icons from icon libraries like:
   - https://www.flaticon.com/
   - https://icons8.com/
   - https://iconmonstr.com/

The icons should represent the Parivahan/transport theme with elements like:
- Car/vehicle symbols
- Indian flag colors
- Government/official styling

For now, you can use placeholder colored squares or convert any suitable images to the required sizes.
